# WCE DevOps

Monorepo for WCE DevOps team.

## Objective

> *"Engineers are hired to solve a problem, and should not spend countless hours configuring their environment to solve said problem. Thus, environment configuration becomes a different problem for a different engineer to solve."*

The objective of the WCE DevOps team is to create implement an efficient, robust, and extensible CI/CD pipeline and computer programming framework for students taking courses or building projects at Michigan Technological University. We are working hard to encourage experience with industry-standard tooling by creating programming templates complete with:

- Automated Testing APIs
- Automated Build System Configuration
- VSCode Environment Configuration
- User-friendly Remote Development
- User-friendly Containerized Development

## Keep Up with the Project

For now, keep track this GitHub page or [the WCE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LjYp-lTtjc) for updates. In the future, we plan to setup a mailing list and blog.
