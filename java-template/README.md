# Java Programming Template

The Java programming template is generated and built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

## Requirements

[Java SDK (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

## Usage

Using our project template it easy to use out of the box. Simply add source code or test code as you please in the appropriate directories. In our template, we provide you with `src/main/java/app/App.java` with some boilerplate source code, and `src/main/java/app/AppTest.java` for boilerplate test code.

```sh
bash ./build.sh # Compile your source code.
bash ./run.sh   # Run your source code. If you've made changes, be sure to build first :)
bash ./test.sh  # Compile and run your test code 
```
