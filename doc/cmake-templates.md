# Implementing and Using CMake Templates

## Table of Contents


## Introduction

CMake is a robust and complex build system management tool. It offers a variety of features that won't be covered in this documentation, and thus I advise you to read [the official documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/). For the purposes of the WCE DevOps Project, CMake is the perfect choice for designing programming templates for MTU courses and projects that make use of C or C++. The most important features for such an application are as follows:

* Easy integration with popular modern code editors and IDEs. Ideal for both a pre-determined workspace for beginners or an alternative toolset used by those with more experience.

* Modular conditional building functionality for managing several build configurations. Ideal for designing projects that are easy to test, debug, and version control.

* 

Perhaps most usefully of all, CMake is the industry standard. For this reason, it can provide students with experience in professional tooling.
